      <description>In Paris the metro is a daily necessity for most of us.
It has 14 major lines and has around 220 km of railroads. One original fact, compared to other European subway, is that stops are quite close : on average, the inter-distance between 2 stations is 550 m.
Lately I had a discussion and we tried to figure out when you should take it to avoid rush hours.</description>
