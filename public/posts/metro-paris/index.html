<p>In Paris the metro is a daily necessity for most of us.</p>

<p>It has 14 major lines and has around 220 km of railroads. One original fact, compared to other European subway, is that stops are quite close : on average, the inter-distance between 2 stations is 550 m.</p>

<p>Lately I had a discussion and we tried to figure out when you should take it to avoid rush hours.</p>

<p>Common wisdom will say to <strong>avoid</strong> :</p>

<ul>
<li>in the morning : between 8 to 9h</li>
<li>in the evening : between 17 to 19h</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sense from my experience. However I was wondering : is there any data that can tackle this question ?</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-data">Getting the data</h2>

<p>After some googling there is not many data regarding the number of people that get in and out, on a fine grain, of a metro station.</p>

<p>Still, <a href="https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/">iledefrance-mobilites</a> published lately multiple datasets regarding the number of travelers that gets into a station in 2017.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of datasets that are available, the first one describe the number of daily travelers that validated their ticket at a specific stop.
The other is a hourly ticket validation percentage , built according to some homemade profile, the methodology used does not seem to be explained anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="tell-me-more">Tell me more</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get a sense of the number of people that get a ride every month on the metro</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/metro/monthly-traveler.png" alt="monthly traveler in millions" /></p>

<p>There is an expected deep in August when public holidays occur.</p>

<p>An interesting insight is to check how they are distributed across lines</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/metro/daily-passenger-distribution.png" alt="daily passenger distribution" /></p>

<p>Each point represents the daily number of travelers</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll now dive into the second dataset regarding prebuilt profile.</p>

<p>There are 5 profiles defined :</p>

<ul>
<li>Working day outside of public school holidays</li>
<li>Saturdays outside of public school holidays</li>
<li>Working day during public school holidays</li>
<li>Saturdays during public school holidays</li>
<li>Sundays and public holidays(Christmas,&hellip;)</li>
</ul>

<p>The hourly percentage is defined as : the number of daily validation to a specific station divided by the daily validation, therefore percentage on a given day sum-up to 100.</p>

<p>Hereafter an overview</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/metro/average-metro-user-per-hour.png" alt="average-metro-user-per-hour" /></p>

<p>And for each profile</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/metro/facet-grid-user-per-hour.png" alt="facet-profile" /></p>

<h2 id="so">So ?</h2>

<p>Looks like the common wisdom is correct on average. However distribution is not the same for all stop, and it can make sense to go or leave for different hours.</p>

<p>I have set up a power plot <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDg0NWRhNTYtMGY1Zi00ZjA5LTlhYTctNDQyYjgyMmI3ZTEwIiwidCI6IjkwYzdhMjBhLWYzNGItNDBiZi1iYzQ4LWI5MjUzYjZmNWQyMCIsImMiOjh9">here</a> if you want to explore more about it.</p>
